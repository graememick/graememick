### Hello 👋

I'm Graeme. I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer with a background in Audio Engineering 🎤
I am currently enamored with learning new programming languages, and I enjoy looking for elegant solutions to complex problems 🧮

My path to engineering stems from my love of building things and my insatiable hunger to keep learning things 🔭 
I began to teach myself programing through online courses and finally made the decision to pursue software engineering as my full-time career 🌱

Recently, I developed Tango Atsumare with a small team 👯‍♀️👯‍♂️
Tango Atsumare is an SRS flashcard app using OCR to allow users to create flashcards easily from images 🤳 and a social media aspect for allowing you to share, search and download cards created by other users 📱💻

Some of the tech I use:
⚡ JavaScript, React, React-native, Node.js, Git, PSQL, HTML, CSS, Express, Knex, TypeScript, Unity, C#, Vue, MongoDB, GraphQL, Docker
