### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Graeme. I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer with a background in Audio Engineering ðŸŽ¤
I am currently enamored with learning new programming languages, and I enjoy looking for elegant solutions to complex problems ðŸ§®

My path to engineering stems from my love of building things and my insatiable need to keep learning ðŸ”­ 
I began to teach myself programing through online courses and finally made the decision to pursue software engineering as my full-time career ðŸŒ±

Recently, I developed Tango Atsumare with a small team, a mobile app that uses OCR to allow users to create flashcards from images ðŸ¤³ and share them with others.
See of demo here:

âš¡ JavaScript, React, React-native, Node.js, Git, PSQL, HTML, CSS, Express, Knex, TypeScript, Unity, C#, Vue, MongoDB, GraphQL, Docker
